## What?

Well, it's an app to calculate your IP based on each matkul verdict (A, AB, B, BC, C, D, E). I've been obsessed by my own IP coz yknow TPB forced me to got better IP or i'll got kicked to another study than Informatics, _sigh_.

## Features

- Keep you away from pesky insecure self by predicting your own IP.
- It's fully functional, yeah, you can create your own matkul and just have fun around it.

- It also include um... save and load data so you can't lost your progress.. _i hope_.

## Cons
- No, this is not a way to got better IP. Please do it by your own hard work.
